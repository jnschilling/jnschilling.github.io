# Linux as an application
From dual boot to virtual servers to docker apps, now windows made it possible to run the lastest ubuntu version (debian...) directly on W10.
## Why doing it ? 
My first reason is practical.
The versatility of Ubuntu plateform give the opportunity to stay tuned on Python and Ruby libraries, run them and apply the change on windows files.
The other reason is that the MS store allow to synchronise multiple device application installation. You install it once and MS store does the rest on the other devices (@home, @work) !

## how does it work ?

1. Run the following command **as administrator** in Powershell (source:[windows-wsl])
```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```
Restart the computer...

2. Install the application 
Wait for installation to end

# Update Tweak the Linux
3. Update ubuntu - one line to ru(i)n it all clean (the version provided is not updated)
```linux
	sudo bash -c 'for i in update {,dist-}upgrade auto{remove,clean}; do apt-get $i -y; done'
```
	> that's a funny code up thereunb
4. optional command line what I like to do from the beginning (source:[run-sudo-nopwd])
allow me to use sudo without password open the **sudoers** file:
```linux
	sudo visudo
```
5. and add the following line replace `<username>`: 
```linux
<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
I am running this under a session of (secured) windows, so I am not running into security issues doing so.

6. list your windows-files and go to your common dev environment (replace `<windows_user>`)
```linux
sudo mount -t drvfs C: /mnt/c/users/<window_user>/dev -o metadata,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=22,fmask=111
ll /mnt/c/users/<windows_user>/dev
cd /mnt/c/users/<windows_user>/dev
```
> note `ll` stands for `ls --color=auto -alF `

# your ubuntu W10 instance is ready to boogy!
ready to start with : [jekyll-install] for example 

## jns backlog:
- [x] 1. WSL for windows
- [x] 2. Install the application
- [x] 3. update ubuntu
- [x] 4. sudoers
- [x] 5. sudo no pwd
- [x] 6. move to dev env
- [ ] 7. automatic startup in current dev environment
