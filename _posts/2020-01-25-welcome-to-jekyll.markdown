# Static website building has never been so easy.
I did many trials in website building, I has never been so efficient and (easy). Once it is set up.
Static website can have many use : 
- blogging
- making project pages
The following combination allows that: 
- Jekyll builder
- Github integration
- Some plugins, many plugins but that you set in text.

# As reference below, 
I will keep the jekyll information below for future reference. 

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
